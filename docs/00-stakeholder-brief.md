# Stakeholder Brief (Intentionally Incomplete)

We run a small appointment-based business. We need a booking system that customers can use online and staff can manage.

## What we think we need
- Customers can create an account and book an appointment.
- Staff can define services (name, duration, price).
- Staff can set availability.
- Customers get an email confirmation.
- Staff can see the schedule.

## What we did not specify (agent must ask)
- Time zone handling
- Overbooking policy (strictly prevent overlaps vs allow double-booking)
- Cancellation/reschedule rules (fees, cutoffs, refunds)
- Lead time rules (e.g., must book at least 2 hours ahead)
- Buffer time between appointments
- Roles/permissions (admin vs staff)
- Multi-location support
- Reporting needs
- Data retention/audit needs
- Any payment/deposit requirements
